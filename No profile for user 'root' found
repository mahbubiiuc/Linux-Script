Problem: User profile crashed or wrongly mapped

Your session only lasted less than 10 seconds. If you have not logged out yourself., 
this could mean that there is some installation problem or that you may be out of diskspace. 
Try logging in with one of the failsafe sessions to see if you can fix this problem

No profile for user 'root' found
/bin/sh: /home/oracle:/bin/bash: No such file or directory
1.	Check vim /etc/passwd and see whether root is mapped properly. In this case this is the error.  So login assingle user mode:
	a. Press any key while booting
	b. Press e 
	c. Press e on the quiet option at next screen
	d. At entry mode write single instead of quiet
	e. press enter to get back and press b to boot

2.	See permission for root on /bin/sh
ls -lart /bin/sh

3.	See permission for root on /tmp
ls -lart /temp

to give permission if anyone of 1 & 2 denied do:  chmod -R 777 /tmp
4.	See disk space if whether its full or not
df â€“h

5.	See whether /root/.bash_profile exists or not usually u can't conenct  as root as other user u'll get permission error if profile does not exist
vi /root/.bash_profile OR cat /root/.bash_profile

6.	To list you can check
ll /root/.bash_profile from oracle usre

7.	See whetehr there is any problem at ssh:
tail -f -n 10 /etc/ssh/ssh_config

8.	 See condition of root user: 
id root
